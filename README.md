proj_kaggle_titanic
===================

I've decided to upload my code for Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted)  knowledge competition after some revising a year later. Running the code "as-is" will get you about 0.79 AUC - I've **gimped** the parameters to preserve the spirit of the competition. Tuning the parameters, such as the grid search, and feature selection can help improve this code. As of 23 November 2014, I was able to realize 0.81818 AUC on the *public* [leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/leaderboard) (search "a running pudge") for whatever it's worth.

Please share any improvements with me at thomasyokota at gmail.com. I'm always up for learning, collaboration and all that jazz.

Mahalo.
